    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Clique Bait is not like your regular online seafood store - the founder and CEO Danny, was also a part of a digital data analytics team and wanted to expand his knowledge into the seafood industry!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study - you are required to support Danny’s vision and analyse his dataset and come up with creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates for the Clique Bait online store.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this case study there is a total of 5 datasets which you will need to combine to solve all of the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Users\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers who visit the Clique Bait website are tagged via their `cookie_id`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer visits are logged in this `events` table at a `cookie_id` level and the `event_type` and `page_id` values can be used to join onto relevant satellite tables to obtain further information about each event.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sequence_number` is used to order the events within each visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](week6b.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Event Identifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The `event_identifier` table shows the types of events which are captured by Clique Bait’s digital data systems.\n",

    "![image](week6c.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Campaign Identifier\n",
    "\n",
    "This table shows information for the 3 campaigns that Clique Bait has ran on their website so far in 2020.\n",

    "This case study is based off my many years working with Digital datasets in consumer banking and retail supermarkets - all of the datasets are designed based off real datasets I’ve come across in challenging problem solving scenarios and the questions reflect similar problems which I worked on.\n",
