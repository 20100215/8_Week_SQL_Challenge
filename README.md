# 8 Week SQL Challenge

![8 Week SQL Challenge](https://github.com/20100215/8_Week_SQL_Challenge/assets/84717650/32e1f6a2-e641-41ca-b4d1-8901a2f42a20)

A compilation of case study solutions with practical and complex SQL queries for data manipulation, analysis, and reporting covering the following domains of analytics: Health, marketing, people, finance, fast moving consumer goods, and digital marketing. This demonstrates my proficiency in writing SQL queries, solving problems, and obtaining key metrics in every challenge. Created by Data with Danny (Source: [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/))

For starters: [Read here](https://www.quanthub.com/why-is-sql-important-for-data-management-and-analysis/) on why SQL is an essential skill for all data-related roles such as data engineers and data analysts.

**Skills: Data Preparation, Data Cleaning, Data Management, Data Analysis and Reporting**

**Tools: SQLite, Jupyter Notebook**
